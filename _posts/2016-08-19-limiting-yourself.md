Why do people enjoy camping? Why go to great lenghts to sleep on uncomfortable beds with leaking roofs?

itinI do think that one of the answers is: simplicity. We long to get back to a simpler life (for a while) with limited options of what to do and what to concern ourselves with. This helps much to relax and enjoy that which we have limited ourselves to. And this is what i want to get at. While scarcity can drive one to wrong decisions (see here for a good treatment on teh subject), consciously limiting yourself can bring a much appreciated focus dividend.

I got inspired to the subject by magician Benjamin Earl in an episode of the Magicians Podcast, produced by Richard Young, where Earl describes how limiting yourself to a few techniques or objects you can create much stronger Magic becaue of the focus on small details and the need to. make the most out of what you have got. He likens this to the relationship between actor and mime, where the mime is so restricted, yet can often convey strong emotions because of It.

So I am thinking about what that means to me. And I realize that when I am constantly thinking about new ways to be creative and new projects and doing things differently, I miss the whole world of exploring a single thing to the end. Instead of many tools, why not try to do all with a knife for a time nd really limit myself and thereby explore what I can really do with a knife. Why not stop using new methods and props for tricks and just stick to the single ghost key and explore all it has to give and all the stories to go with it.
