title: The Bardic Archetype
publisher:
  name: Markus Pfeil
description: >-
  I always imagined myself to be a bard. Maybe not always, but from the moment I
  held the Players Manual to AD&D in my hands and it dawned on me that there was
  an archetype in humanity of a jack of all trades, connecting many skills with
  story and song. The guy that is no expert, but, left on his own has his ways
  of doing anything. McGyver meets Copperfield. So I try to learn a lot of
  things. I try to know a lot of things. I try to be prepared. And I realized
  along the way that you can only learn so much when you try to walk your path
  trough life and learn as an extra-live-curricular activity.

I always imagined myself to be a bard. Maybe not always, but from the moment I held the Players Manual to AD&D in my hands and it dawned on me that there was an archetype in humanity of a jack of all trades, connecting many skills with story and song. The guy that is no expert, but, left on his own has his ways of doing anything. McGyver meets Copperfield. So I try to learn a lot of things. I try to know a lot of things. I try to be prepared. And I realized along the way that you can only learn so much when you try to walk your path trough life and learn as an extra-live-curricular activity.

It just takes up a lot of time to do so. Many skills have to be practised to retain them. Taking things with you that you need for some of the nifty things you learned fills up your daypack and drains your memory (as you need to know what you have and where).

So, increasingly I try to be something, rather than do it. Let me give an example. If I want to do magic tricks, I can practise them, rehearse performances and become reasonably good. But it will eat up several hours per week. I have three kids, that are, of course, in the centre of my free time. So I can relegate the practise sessions in the evenings. Making me anxious when the kids do not want to go to bed. There goes my session. Or I can try to be a Magician and do small tricks for them during my time with them. I can integrate a more grownup trick in a talk I give at work or in a social event. I can be a Magician. This teaches me to pick those things that have a useful level of difficulty, do not have too much upkeep and are useable in my life. These concepts and some applications will be addressed in this blog.
