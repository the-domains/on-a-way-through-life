I am a 44, sorry say 29 (15 revolutions over) guy from the south of Germany. I am married (very happily, with a numerical addiction to 13) and have three fantastic (ly loud) kids and enjoy magic (of every kind), cards, music (accordion, guitar, singing) cycling and nature. 

Since my early teens I have been EDCing, even when there was o word for it. I carried knives, paracord, medical supplies and books and always waited for an opportunity to "be ready for". Now I had to grow up (some) and I began to try and be less prepared and more ready. So I have started to think more about why I want to be ready for what and how I can do what I want with less to carry. 

I also have always tried to know and do many things. So, given that I learned a lot in the last decades I also forgot a lot and a lot of skills fell into disuse. So I started to think about what I can do to integrate things I "do" into things I "am" in order to be able to do more while still forgetting a lot. 

Yup.
