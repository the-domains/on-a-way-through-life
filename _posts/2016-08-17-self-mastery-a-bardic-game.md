title: Self Mastery - a bardic Game
publisher:
  name: Markus Pfeil
description: >-
  Inspiration is somethin a Bard desperately needs. And when in need it can be
  hard to come by. Enter this beauty of a game. When playing the selfmastery
  game, each player tries to answer a personal question or get insight to
  something or other. By running through the game, they get inspiration in he
  form of text snippets or questions to be answered. Though the snippets are of
  course somewhat generic they are masterfully generated so that you can relate
  them to your personal question and get lots of input to answer the question
  yourself. You can even play this with kids, there is no mature content in
  there. Excellent stuff.
