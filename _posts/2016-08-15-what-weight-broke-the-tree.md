What defines a worthwhile skill or tool? This is a question that I have been trying to assess for some time now. Whether it comes to chosing a sport, learning some skill or finding "the perfect" kit to have in my pockets, I was and am, not content with my decisions most of the time.

Do I carry a swiss army knife (small, lightweight, legal to carry in Germany, can go in the suit if neccessary) or a leatherman tool (has the pliers, opens one handed, can own but not carry under all circumstances where I live, makes the suit a wardrobe malfunction)? I tried both for a time and kept oscillating.

Do I learn Aikido or just plain cycle? Aikido has the self defense bit, but is less endurance building. But then to defend myself using Aikido I need to practice a lot and cycling I can do en route to work in stead of the bus.

These kinds of decisions led me to try and find criteria to go by. Then reading 98.6 Degrees, The Art of keeping your Ass alive told me where to look. The book basically says, that if you want to stay alive, all you have to do is breathe and stay warm. Food? Relevant after 30-40 days maybe. Water? Relevant after one or two days and often accessible.

     <a href="https://www.amazon.de/98-6-Degrees-Art-Keepi-NONE-ebook/dp/B00B1L0M50/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=#">98.6 Degrees - The Art of keeping your Ass alive</a>

So, trying to work out what is really necessary, I came up with the following criteria:

* Context - Stories that require a response from me - these define what I want to be able to react to
* Skill, Item or Background - are we talking about a skill, such as swimming, an item, such as a knife or a background, such as having hazard insurance.
* Usefulness - How useful is it when I can use it in a specific context
* Frequency - How often can I expect to use it in that context
* Criticality - How critical is it if I do not have it in an Emergency
* Complexity - Do I have to train to use it, or is it dead simple
* Upkeep - Does it need charging, watching, replacing, practicing
* Encumbrance - How much does it hinder me. If it is really essential, can it go into my suit?

These of course need to be evaluated for various scenarios, which, in turn will vary for each of us. For me some important ones are:

* Daily Grind - Go to work, interact with people and my kids, be around home
* Hiking - Go off the beaten track, expose myself to some risk of injury while out of immediate reach of help
* Accident - Either on the bike, with the car or otherwise
* Minor Disaster - House Fire, Train Wreck or such.

I do not prepare for the often quoted "Shit hits the Fan" Scenario in terms of carrying things around for it with me, as this requires so much upkeep and encumbrance that it harms more than it does good.

So for each of these scenarios we can go through the list of contexts and then find what is useful to have as a skill and an item.
