Reflecting on my thoughts on what is practical, useful for real EVERY day carry and most impact, I want to speak shortly about my EDC knife. 

The Microtec Mini UDT is the smallest version in the UDT (Underwater Demolition Team) automatic knife series. Starting in the mid 1990's it was one of the fastest selling knives in the Microtech history. The Mini UDT features a 154CM blade with a reinforced tip for maximum penetration effectiveness without compromising the tip. Its handle is a 6061T6 aircraft grade aluminum with high-grip inserts. It has a blade length of 5 cm. 

I used to carry Leatherman and Victorinox Multitools, Swiss Army Knifes and a lot else. I have been driven to most of the temporary choices by the perceived need to have a tool ready for cutting up things, undoing packaging, cutting paper and repairing things. In the end I always started small and then moved on to larger and larger tools that could do more and more things. And at some point, I had to leave it at home because, I had to wear a suit for work and the Leatherman Charge just drew it down so visibly in the jacket pocket that it was useless and the belt pouch produced such a battle at the bulge that I cold not wear it. So, it was left at home and either no replacement or a small pocket knife. 

You get the gist of the item. It needs to be Edc with a capital E. The knife is probably the most useful item together with the torch, so it needs an E. The Microtec UDT is small enough that it fits the small "spare button" pocket in a suit and that it can ride on a belt of any pair of pants or shorts. The only place it cannot go is in handluggage on a flight. Now this is a decision I took that a knife small enough for handluggage is too small to be my EDC. So in that case I have to wait till landing for it. Alternative solutions in an alternative post. 

For strongly legislated countries like Germany I have removed the opening spring from the UDT, so the button just locks and unlocks the knife, but does not open it automatically. This makes it perfectly legal to carry down here. If I want I can simply reinstall the spring at a different time and location.
