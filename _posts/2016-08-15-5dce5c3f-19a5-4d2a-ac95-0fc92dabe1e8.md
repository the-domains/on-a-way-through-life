A source of light is, next to the knife, one of the two m important items in EDC. Here I have a changing preference as the world of LED lighting is a fastly changing one.

My current choice is a Fenix RC09\. This choice is rooted in the following need scenarios:

1. Easily accessible light for coming home late
2. Replacement for a broken cycle light.
3. Work light

These translate into:

1. Often used - rechargeable
2. Carry to work - small enough for suit
3. Work light - Stand on tail
4. Quick access - clicky

The RC09 does all that. There is one downside to it, and that is a custom charging cable. But that comes with the water resistant connector and it is bearable as I can still change the battery.

Here is a useful review:
