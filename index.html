Why go to great lenghts to sleep on uncomfortable beds with leaking roofs?</p><p>itinI do think that one of the answers is: simplicity. We long to get back to a simpler life (for a while) with limited options of what to do and what to concern ourselves with. This helps much to relax and enjoy that which we have limited ourselves to. And this is what i want to get at. While scarcity can drive one to wrong decisions (see here for a good treatment on teh subject), consciously limiting yourself can bring a much appreciated focus dividend.</p><article><picture>

The guy that is no expert, but, left on his own has his ways of doing anything. McGyver meets Copperfield. So I try to learn a lot of things. I try to know a lot of things. I try to be prepared.

Let me give an example. If I want to do magic tricks, I can practise them, rehearse performances and become reasonably good. But it will eat up several hours per week. I have three kids, that are, of course, in the centre of my free time. So I can relegate the practise sessions in the evenings. Making me anxious when the kids do not want to go to bed. There goes my session. Or I can try to be a Magician and do small tricks for them during my time with them. I can integrate a more grownup trick in a talk I give at work or in a social event. I can be a Magician. This teaches me to pick those things that have a useful level of difficulty, do not have too much upkeep and are useable in my life. These concepts and some applications will be addressed in this blog.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="134"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="135"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/69ad7bf2-bc24-424e-b6c9-d2abfbca1989.jpg" title="Microtec UDT" alt="Microtec  "><p>Reflecting on my thoughts on what is practical, useful for real EVERY day carry and most impact, I want to speak shortly about my EDC knife. </p><p>The Microtec Mini UDT is the smallest version in the UDT (Underwater Demolition Team) automatic knife series. Starting in the mid 1990's it was one of the fastest selling knives in the Microtech history. The Mini UDT features a 154CM blade with a reinforced tip for maximum penetration effectiveness without compromising the tip. Its handle is a 6061T6 aircraft grade aluminum with high-grip inserts. It has a blade length of 5 cm. </p><p>I used to carry Leatherman and Victorinox Multitools, Swiss Army Knifes and a lot else. I have been driven to most of the temporary choices by the perceived need to have a tool ready for cutting up things, undoing packaging, cutting paper and repairing things. In the end I always started small and then moved on to larger and larger tools that could do more and more things. And at some point, I had to leave it at home because, I had to wear a suit for work and the Leatherman Charge just drew it down so visibly in the jacket pocket that it was useless and the belt pouch produced such a battle at the bulge that I cold not wear it. So, it was left at home and either no replacement or a small pocket knife. </p><p>You get the gist of the item. It needs to be Edc with a capital E. The knife is probably the most useful item together with the torch, so it needs an E. The Microtec UDT is small enough that it fits the small “spare button” pocket in a suit and that it can ride on a belt of any pair of pants or shorts. The only place it cannot go is in handluggage on a flight. Now this is a decision I took that a knife small enough for handluggage is too small to be my EDC. So in that case I have to wait till landing for it. Alternative solutions in an alternative post. </p><p>For strongly legislated countries like Germany I have removed the opening spring from the UDT, so the button just locks and unlocks the knife, but does not open it automatically. This makes it perfectly legal to carry down here. If I want I can simply reinstall the spring at a different time and location. </p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="136"><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="137"><h5 data-reactid="138"><span class="Author f-s-xxs  color-box-pop" data-reactid="139">Markus Pfeil</span></h5></div></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="140"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="141"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/910256cc-7a17-42b0-b278-0c9af31b43b8.jpg" title="What weight broke the Tree?" alt="What is worth my while?"><p>What defines a worthwhile skill or tool? This is a question that I have been trying to assess for some time now. Whether it comes to chosing a sport, learning some skill or finding “the perfect” kit to have in my pockets, I was and am, not content with my decisions most of the time.</p><p>Do I carry a swiss army knife (small, lightweight, legal to carry in Germany, can go in the suit if neccessary) or a leatherman tool (has the pliers, opens one handed, can own but not carry under all circumstances where I live, makes the suit a wardrobe malfunction)? I tried both for a time and kept oscillating.</p><p>Do I learn Aikido or just plain cycle? Aikido has the self defense bit, but is less endurance building. But then to defend myself using Aikido I need to practice a lot and cycling I can do en route to work in stead of the bus.</p><p>These kinds of decisions led me to try and find criteria to go by. Then reading 98.6 Degrees, The Art of keeping your Ass alive told me where to look. The book basically says, that if you want to stay alive, all you have to do is breathe and stay warm. Food? Relevant after 30-40 days maybe. Water? Relevant after one or two days and often accessible.</p><pre><code> &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/98-6-Degrees-Art-Keepi-NONE-ebook/dp/B00B1L0M50/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=#&quot;&gt;98.6 Degrees - The Art of keeping your Ass alive&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>So, trying to work out what is really necessary, I came up with the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Context - Stories that require a response from me - these define what I want to be able to react to</li><li>Skill, Item or Background - are we talking about a skill, such as swimming, an item, such as a knife or a background, such as having hazard insurance.</li><li>Usefulness - How useful is it when I can use it in a specific context</li><li>Frequency - How often can I expect to use it in that context</li><li>Criticality - How critical is it if I do not have it in an Emergency</li><li>Complexity - Do I have to train to use it, or is it dead simple</li><li>Upkeep - Does it need charging, watching, replacing, practicing</li><li>Encumbrance - How much does it hinder me. If it is really essential, can it go into my suit?</li></ul><p>These of course need to be evaluated for various scenarios, which, in turn will vary for each of us. For me some important ones are:</p><ul><li>Daily Grind - Go to work, interact with people and my kids, be around home</li><li>Hiking - Go off the beaten track, expose myself to some risk of injury while out of immediate reach of help</li><li>Accident - Either on the bike, with the car or otherwise</li><li>Minor Disaster - House Fire, Train Wreck or such.</li></ul><p>I do not prepare for the often quoted “Shit hits the Fan” Scenario in terms of carrying things around for it with me, as this requires so much upkeep and encumbrance that it harms more than it does good.</p><p>So for each of these scenarios we can go through the list of contexts and then find what is useful to have as a skill and an item.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="142"><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="143"><h5 data-reactid="144"><span class="Author f-s-xxs  color-box-pop" data-reactid="145">Markus Pfeil</span></h5></div></div></section></div><section id="10" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="146"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="147"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="148"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="149"><span data-reactid="150"><!-- react-empty: 151 --><h2 data-reactid="152"><a data-reactid="153">On a way through life</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="154"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="155"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="156"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="157"></div></section></div></div>
